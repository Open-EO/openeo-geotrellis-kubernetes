# This CWL uses a Docker image that was built from this Dockerfile:
# https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-geopyspark-driver/blob/b65335184b2050ff38ce6997a0d4344c227cec9f/docker/local_batch_job/example_stac_catalog/Dockerfile
# It's a very simple image that just packages some JSON and TIFF files
# from the example STAC collection at https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-geopyspark-driver/tree/b65335184b2050ff38ce6997a0d4344c227cec9f/docker/local_batch_job/example_stac_catalog
# This CWL just extracts these resources again and provides them as CWL output.
